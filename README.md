SUMMATIVE ASSIGNMENT
Introduction
In    the    past      decade,      executive      compensation      has      become      a      contentious      issue,particularly         in         light      of      recent      financial      crises      and      debates      over      excessive   remuneration    packages.                Critics    have      pointed      out      that      some      executives      have   received   disproportionately   high   compensation,   even   when   corporate   performance   and    stock      prices      have      been    on      the      decline.                   Effective    corporate    governance   mechanisms   are   crucial   in   influencing   the   level   of   executive   compensation.          The   board   of   directors,   and   more   specifically   the   remuneration   committee,   plays   a   vital   role    in    determining      both      the      amount      and      the      structure      of      these      compensation packages
Data   Sets
For    this    assignment,      you       are       provided    with    a       dataset    titled       Determinants       of   Remuneration   Data   Set.       This    dataset   will    serve   as   the   foundation   for   both   your descriptive and predictive   analytics.
Descriptive Analytics
You   are   required   to   conduct   a   thorough   descriptive   analysis   of   all   variables   in   the   dataset.    The analysis should cover key statistical   measures,   including:
•               Mean
•               Standard deviation
•               Range
•               Skewness
•               KurtosisIn   addition, you   should visualise the trends   over   the   three   years   covered   in   the   data.   You   can   employ   various   graphical   techniques   to   present   these   trends.         Tools   like   Tableau   can   be   useful   for   generating   heat   maps   and   other   visualisations   to   support   your analysis.


Diagnostic Analytics
You   are   required   to   conduct   a   thorough   diagnostic   analysis   using   the   two   types   of correlation   models,   briefly discuss which   model   is the   most appropriat代 写Big Data AnalyticsProlog

Predictive AnalyticsUsing   panel   data   regressions,   you   are   required   to   develop   and   analyse   two   models.   For   each   model,   firstly,   you   need   to   conduct   OLS   to   comment   on   multicollinearity,   Secondly,   determine whether to   use fixed   effects   or   random   effects   as the   main test,   while   employing   the   Hausman   test   to   choose   between   them   and   conduct   sensitivity   analysis.    Additionally, you will   need to   evaluate   the   models’   sufficiency   and   strength   by    using    appropriate    statistical    measures    and    discussing    the    significance    of    the   relationships between dependent and independent variables.
Model   1:
Total calculated compensation
=   Y0   +   Y1   Board size + Y2    Board   External Members
+ Y3    cEO  chairDuality   +   Y4   Remuneration committee size
+   Y5   Remuneration committee Number of   Meetings
+   Y6       Duality of chairman of the Remuneration committe  chairman of the board
+   Y7   chairman compensation   + Y8Total Members compensation   + εit
Model 2:
Total Annual cash compensation
=   Y0   +   Y1   Board size + Y2    Board External Members + Y3    cEO  chair Duality +   Y4
Remuneration committee size
+   Y5   Remuneration committee Number of   Meetings
+   Y6       Duality   of   chairman   of   the   Remuneration   committe    chairman   of   the   Board
+   Y7   chairman compensation   + Y8Total Members compensation   + εit




Additional Instructions
•             STATA must   be   used for   all statistical analysis,   unless   otherwise   specified.
•             You are   required to   include screenshots of STATA outputs   in your   appendices.
•             Ensure    that    any   Tableau   visualizations   you   create   are   effectively   integrated   with and discussed alongside the results obtained from   your   STATA analysis.
•             Make   sure   to   reference   appropriate   academic   literature   or   reports   to   support   your findings and interpretations.
